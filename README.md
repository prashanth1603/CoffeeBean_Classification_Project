# CoffeeBean_Classification_Project
This repository contains a coffee beans classification model that classifies images of coffee beans into one of four categories: Dark, Green, Light, or Medium. The model was trained using a dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of coffee beans images. The training dataset contains 1600 images, and the model achieved an accuracy of 98.7% when tested on a separate dataset of 400 images.

Dataset
The dataset used for training this model was sourced from Kaggle and includes a diverse range of coffee beans images. It is recommended to ensure that the images to be classified are resized to a dimension of 224x224x3 before feeding them into the model. This is because the model was trained specifically on images of this size.

Model Architecture
The coffee beans classification model was built using a Dense Neural Network, designed for multiclass classification. The architecture of the model has been fine-tuned and optimized to achieve high accuracy on the coffee beans dataset. The model has been trained with various optimization techniques to ensure robust performance.
